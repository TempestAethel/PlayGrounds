# **Coromon: Best Use of Coins Guide**

Managing your coins efficiently in *Coromon* can significantly enhance your gameplay. This guide explains how to use coins for maximum benefits, based on a step-by-step strategy that includes upgrading your gear, utilizing discounts, and stocking essential items.

---

## **Step 1: Maximize Upgrades**

First, focus on fully upgrading your build. Prioritize upgrades that boost your combat performance and enhance item acquisition, such as:

- **Gear Upgrades**: Ensure your weapons, armor, and utilities are maxed out.
- **Core Facilities**: Invest in expanding your item-carrying capacity or healing efficiency.

The screenshot above shows my current build, which is fully maxed out.

---

## **Step 2: Sell Non-Essential Items**

To gather coins efficiently, sell off all non-essential items, such as low-tier spinners and potions. Retain only the following:

- **Platinum Spinners** (useful for capturing high-tier Coromon).
- **Gems** (critical for crafting and trading).
- **Potentiflator Tokens** (used for upgrading potential).

By doing this, you can consolidate your funds to purchase essential resources in bulk later.

---

## **Step 3: Buying Items in Bulk with Discounts**

Once you’ve gathered enough coins, find an opportunity to purchase high-value items in bulk. Utilize discounts to save a significant amount of money.

- **Bulk Purchase Discounts**: Look for stores offering up to 75% off on bulk purchases.
- **Prioritize**: Focus on restocking healing items, powerful spinners, and high-tier potions.

## **Step 4: Applying Discounts**

Before finalizing your purchase, apply any available discounts. For this step, I used a **75% discount**, which allowed me to maximize my spending and stock up on essential supplies.

3. **Buy in Bulk**: Always use discounts to make the most of your coins.

# Coromon: Evolution, Potential, and Perfect Explained

*Coromon* is a monster-taming RPG that features unique mechanics like **Potential**, **Perfect** forms, and **Evolution**, which add depth to capturing, training, and battling Coromon. This guide explains these mechanics to help you master the game.

---

## **1. Evolution**

Evolution in *Coromon* is the process where your Coromon transforms into a stronger, more advanced form, usually after reaching a specific **level** or fulfilling certain conditions. 

### **How Evolution Works**
- Most Coromon evolve by leveling up [1].
- Some require specific conditions, such as:
  - **Environment-Specific Evolution:** *Lunarpup* evolves into *Ecliptor* only during the night [2].  
  - **Item-Specific Evolution:** *Mino* evolves into *Blazitaur* when exposed to the **Burning Essence** [3].
  - **Friendship or Bonding:** Certain Coromon evolve when their bond with the trainer reaches a high level [4].

### **Benefits of Evolution**
- Increased stats (e.g., Attack, Speed, HP) [1].
- Access to stronger moves and abilities [2].
- New visual designs for your Coromon [4].

### **Canceling Evolution**
- You can prevent a Coromon from evolving by pressing the cancel button during the evolution sequence [1].

### **Strategic Tip**
- Sometimes, delaying evolution allows a Coromon to learn specific moves earlier than their evolved form [3].

---

## **2. Potential**

Potential is a unique mechanic in *Coromon* that determines how powerful your Coromon can become. There are three tiers of potential: **Standard**, **Potent**, and **Perfect**.

### **Potential Tiers**
| Tier     | Potential Value Range | Rarity      |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| Standard | 1-16                   | Common      |
| Potent   | 17-20                  | Uncommon    |
| Perfect  | 21                     | Extremely Rare |

- **Checking Potential:** Use the **Potential Reader** available in the game to determine your Coromon’s potential score [2].
- **Increasing Potential:** Use the **Potentiflator** item to improve a Coromon’s potential. However, upgrading a Coromon to the Perfect tier (21) is extremely rare [3].
- **Impact of Potential:** Higher potential leads to better stat growth and overall battle performance [1].

---

## **3. Perfect Coromon**

Perfect Coromon are rare, special variants with the highest potential score of **21**. They also have unique color palettes, making them highly sought after by collectors and trainers.

### **How to Obtain Perfect Coromon**
1. **Hunting in the Wild:**
   - Perfect Coromon have a very low spawn rate (approximately 1 in 3,192 encounters) [3].
2. **Using the Potentiflator:**
   - Found in the in-game lab, this device can increase a Coromon’s potential. However, the chance to reach Perfect is slim even with this method [4].
3. **Breeding:**
   - Breeding Potent parents increases the likelihood of hatching a higher-potential offspring [2].

### **Why Perfect Coromon Matter**
- Superior stats compared to Standard and Potent Coromon [3].
- Unique appearance with a shiny, alternate color scheme [1].
- Highly prized for competitive battles and as collectibles [4].

---

## **Tips for Trainers**

1. **Use the Potent Scanner:** When capturing Coromon, check their potential score to decide whether to train or replace them [2].
2. **Focus on Potent Hunting:** Potent Coromon are more common than Perfects and offer a good balance of rarity and power [3].
3. **Save Before Encounters:** In areas where Perfect Coromon can spawn, save often and reset if you’re hunting for a specific one [4].
