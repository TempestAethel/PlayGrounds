## **Step 1: Maximize Upgrades**

First, focus on fully upgrading your build. Prioritize upgrades that boost your combat performance and enhance item acquisition, such as:

- **Gear Upgrades**: Ensure your weapons, armor, and utilities are maxed out.
- **Core Facilities**: Invest in expanding your item-carrying capacity or healing efficiency.

## **Step 2: Sell Non-Essential Items**

To gather coins efficiently, sell off all non-essential items, such as low-tier spinners and potions. Retain only the following:

- **Platinum Spinners** (useful for capturing high-tier Coromon).
- **Gems** (critical for crafting and trading).
- **Potentiflator Tokens** (used for upgrading potential).

By doing this, you can consolidate your funds to purchase essential resources in bulk later.

## **Step 3: Buying Items in Bulk with Discounts**

Once youâ€™ve gathered enough coins, find an opportunity to purchase high-value items in bulk. Utilize discounts to save a significant amount of money.

- **Bulk Purchase Discounts**: Look for stores offering up to 75% off on bulk purchases.
- **Prioritize**: Focus on restocking healing items, powerful spinners, and high-tier potions.
